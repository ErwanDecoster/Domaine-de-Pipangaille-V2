    text: "The chateau-like building is located not far from the Rhone in picturesque surroundings. The rooms, all of which are in the attic, are nicely designed in keeping with the style of the building. The two hosts took very good care of us. Unfortunately, on this hot day, the air conditioning in our room was broken. The replacement unit provided was quite loud and not really pleasant. And since it had to be turned off at night, we were forced to leave the window open because of the heat. Unfortunately, there was a party next door, so the night's sleep was not really restful. Despite informing the host, we were not offered any compensation, not even a symbolic bonus. Otherwise, the stay was really very nice. The regional menu prepared by Madame was excellent. My wife's gluten intolerance was also taken into account with excellent gluten-free alternatives. The local wines on offer are also excellent. The French-style breakfast buffet was well stocked and the products were delicious. In conclusion, we can say that a stay there is worthwhile and enjoyable, provided that the air conditioning works in hot weather. However, we would be happy to try again. :-)",

    text: "The B&B is a rural building outside the center of Andancette. It has free parking. The rooms are on the first floor (no elevator) and each room is decorated with a theme (Moroccan, Tuscan, Creole, etc.). Ours was African style and really reminded us a bit of South African lodges with orange/red/ochre colors and a walk-in shower. The room was not very bright but spacious, though one of the two mattresses was a bit uncomfortable. Super fast Wi-Fi. Outside, there is a beautiful garden with a pool, gazebo, and deck chairs for relaxing among the cat and the peacock Shiva. Breakfast is a small buffet of mostly sweet, local products (croissants, bread, jams). On the evening of our arrival, we had dinner (table d'hôte) with regional dishes (including gluten-free options, if requested in advance). Recommended.",

The location itself is beautiful—a lovely authentic building with a large garden, pool, and terrace. The resident peacock also got plenty of attention. Definitely recommended.",

Only French is spoken, and unfortunately no English (nor German, which we don't expect abroad anyway). Due to a mistake, only 2 adults were registered and not our children, aged 15 and 17. However, we knew that the family room had a sofa bed for 2. Upon arrival, we were told this was not possible and that we had to book an additional room. The family room was still charged for more than 2 people (contrary to the price posted on the room door for 2). Since we could only communicate in English, we just accepted it. They could have been more accommodating and offered a supplement for our kids (there was space), or at least charged the family room at the regular 2-person rate (which was what the booking was for). We felt ripped off and a bit cheated. Since the accommodation itself is good and clean: 2 stars. However, we will definitely not stay there again.",

The table d'hôte and breakfast were complete and delicious. Nothing to complain about, except, just to nitpick, there was no TV... but do we really need one in such a setting...? Better to be lulled by the song of the cicadas, right? Thank you for this relaxing stay at your establishment.",
